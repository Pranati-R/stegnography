##SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY
With the rapid expansion of digital communication, securing sensitive data has become more important than ever. Traditional encryption methods can attract attention, making data more vulnerable to interception. Steganography offers a more subtle solution by hiding information within images, making it less detectable.
This project aims to explore and enhance steganographic techniques to provide a secure, imperceptible, and robust method of embedding data within images. It addresses challenges related to maintaining image quality, resistance to detection, and optimizing data capacity.

##Features
Data Security: Hidden data is embedded within images using advanced steganographic techniques, ensuring that the information remains confidential.
Imperceptibility: The image quality is preserved, making it impossible to visually detect the hidden information.
Robustness: The hidden data is resistant to manipulation and attacks such as image compression or format changes.
Encryption: Data can be encrypted before embedding, providing an extra layer of security.

##Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used to implement the steganographic techniques.
OpenCV: A powerful library for image processing tasks like image manipulation, embedding, and extraction.
Tkinter: A Python library used to build a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the steganographic application.

##Future Enhancements
Machine Learning Integration: Future iterations could explore integrating machine learning algorithms to automatically detect optimal embedding locations in images, improving both capacity and security.
Real-Time Steganography: Developing techniques that allow real-time embedding and extraction of hidden data without compromising speed or quality.
Adaptive Methods: Creating adaptive steganographic systems that adjust based on image content and the level of security required.
